Special care should be exercised in patients with impaired renal clearance of dextran. When the risk of pulmonary edema and/or congestive heart failure may be increased, dextran should be used with caution. In patients with normal hemostasis, dosage of LMD (dextran 40) approximating 15 mL/kg of body weight may prolong bleeding time and depress platelet function. Dosages in this range also markedly decrease factor VIII, and decrease factors V and IX to a greater degree than would be expected to occur from hemodilution alone. Since these changes tend to be more pronounced following trauma or major surgery, patients should be observed for early signs of bleeding complications. Since increased rouleaux formation may occur in the presence of dextran, it is recommended that blood samples be drawn for typing and cross-matching prior to the infusion of dextran and reserved for subsequent use if necessary. If blood is drawn after infusion of dextran, the saline agglutination and indirect antiglobulin methods may be used for typing and cross-matching. Difficulty may be encountered when proteolytic enzyme techniques are used to match blood. Consideration should be given to withdrawal of blood for chemical laboratory tests prior to initiating therapy with dextran because of the following: Blood sugar determinations that employ high concentrations of acid may result in hydrolysis of dextran, yielding falsely elevated glucose assay results. This has been observed both with sulfuric acid and with acetic acid. In other laboratory tests, the presence of dextran in the blood may result in the development of turbidity, which can interfere with the assay. This has been observed in bilirubin assays in which alcohol is employed and in total protein assays employing biuret reagent. Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus.

Should therapy continue beyond 24 hours, subsequent dosage should not exceed 10 mL/kg per day and therapy should not continue beyond five days. In prophylaxis of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism, the dosage for adults and adolescents, should be chosen according to the risk of thromboembolic complications, e.g., type of surgery and duration of immobilization. In general, treatment should be initiated during surgery; 500 to 1000 mL (approximately 10 mL/kg of body weight) should be administered on the day of operation.

In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single dose of 80 to 120 mg. In chronic contact dermatitis, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition. Following intramuscular administration of 80 to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks. Similarly, in patients with allergic rhinitis (hay fever), an intramuscular dose of 80 to 120 mg may be followed by relief of coryzal symptoms within six hours persisting for several days to three weeks. If signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.

Following the initial emergency period, consideration should be given to employing a longer acting injectable preparation or an oral preparation. When high dose therapy is desired, the recommended dose of Methyl prednisolone sodium succinate Sterile Powder is 30 mg/kg administered intravenously over at least 30 minutes. This dose may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours for 48 hours. In general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized; usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours. In other indications, initial dosage will vary from 10 to 40 mg of methylprednisolone depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages. It should be emphasized that Dosage Requirements are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. To prepare solutions for intravenous infusion, first prepare the solution for injection as directed. This solution may then be added to indicate amounts of 5% dextrose in water, isotonic saline solution, or 5% dextrose in isotonic saline solution. In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg/m2bsa/day). The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1?2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or 'burst' therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse. Dosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.

The amount depends on ovarian reaction and should be checked by ultrasound examinations of the ovaries and measuring estradiol levels. If the HMG dosage is too high for the treated individual, multiple uni- and bilateral follicle growth can occur. HMG is administered IM or SC and in general, the therapy is begun with a daily dosage corresponding to 75-150 IU FSH + 75-150 IU LH daily. If the ovaries do not respond, the dosage can slowly be increased until a rise in estradiol secretion and follicle growth is evident. Treatment with the same dosage of HMG continues until the preovulatory estradiol serum level is attained. If the level rises too quickly, the dosage should be reduced. To induce ovulation, hCG 5000 or 10,000 IU are injected IM 1-2 days after the last HMG administration. Note: After administering a HMG dosage which is too high for the corresponding individual, a subsequent hCG administration can cause an unintentional hyperstimulation of the ovaries. Sterility in Males: Initially, 3 x 1000 and 3000 IU hCG a week are administered until a normal testosterone serum level is reached.

On occasions when administration at the same time of the day is not possible, Insulin Degludec allows for flexibility in the timing of insulin administration. A minimum of 8 hours between injections should always be ensured. Patients who forget a dose, are advised to take it upon discovery and then resume their usual once-daily dosing schedule. Special populations: Elderly patients (> 65 years old): Insulin Degludec can be used in elderly patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis. Renal and hepatic impairment: Degludec can be used in renal and hepatic impaired patients. Glucose-monitoring is to be intensified and the insulin dose adjusted on an individual basis.

Soluble insulin (also known as 'neutral insulin' or 'regular insulin') is a short-acting preparation. To extend the duration of action of insulin, preparations are formulated as suspensions in 2 methods. The 1st method involves complexing insulin with a protein so that it is slowly released, e.g. protamine zinc insulin (contains an excess of protamine) and isophane insulin (or NPH insulin which contains equal amounts of protamine and insulin). An alternative method is particle size modification e.g. insulin zinc suspensions. While all the formulations can be admin by SC inj, most by IM inj, only soluble insulin can be admin by IV.

Due to the differential density of ?2-adrenoceptors and M3-receptors in central versus smaller airways, ?2-agonists should be more effective in relaxing small airways while an anticholinergic compound may be more effective in large airways. Thus, for optimal bronchodilation in all regions of the human lung, a combination of a ?2-adrenergic agonist and a muscarinic antagonist may be beneficial. Indacaterol: Indacaterol is an 'ultra' long-acting ?2-adrenergic agonist for once-daily administration. The pharmacological effects of ?2-adrenoceptor agonists, including indacaterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP, cyclic monophosphate). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. In vitro studies have shown that indacaterol has >24-fold greater agonist activity at ?2-receptors compared to ?1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to ?3-receptors. This selectivity profile is similar to formoterol. When inhaled, indacaterol acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. Indacaterol is a nearly full agonist at the human ?2-adrenergic receptor with nanomolar potency. In isolated human bronchus, indacaterol has a rapid onset of action and a long duration of action. Glycopyrronium: Glycopyrronium is an inhaled long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (anticholinergic) for once-daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Following oral administration, the drugs inhibit the growth of susceptible organisms (mainly Propionibacterium acnes) on the surface of the skin and reduce the concentration of free fatty acids in sebum. The reduction in free fatty acids in sebum may be an indirect result of the inhibition of lipase-producing organisms which convert triglycerides into free fatty acids or may be a direct result of interference with lipase production in these organisms. Free fatty acids are comedogenic and are believed to be a possible cause of the inflammatory lesions, e.g. papules, pustules, nodules, cysts, of acne.
